# Anthony Torres's Portfolio  

I am a student at CSUF and im majioring in Computer Science and I expect to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
*Lab5 Part, 1 

   This lab was fun because amidst previous challenges of learning coding and starting out, this lab became an enjoyable because it solidified my understanding but also introduced the excitement of working 
with loops while using functions like PromptForInt and RectangleArea to create practical, functional code for calculating rectangle areas PromptForInt.

*Lab 9 Part, 1 

    My second favorite lab offered an engaging exploration of doubles, showing off the importance of handling floating-point values accurately in programming. It also involves the handling of vectors to 
calculate averages using functions like JudgeAverage.

*Lab 12 Part, 1

    My most challenging and favorite lab brought together my year-long learning in coding, vectors, image handling, and precision with floating-point values. Showcasing my skills in working with geometric 
structures and mathematical functions like sine, it resulted in visually stunning animated gradients.
